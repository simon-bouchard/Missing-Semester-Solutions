<h5 id=why>Why this page?</h5>
<p>While completing the missing semester class I came to an exercise I had a hard time completing. I tried looking online for solutions only to find that most people only published the solutions of the first few lectures or didn't have solutions to the harder exercises. I then realised I had to find the solutions myself. So I did.</p>
<p>Fast forward to when I finished the class, I was looking for ways to practice while learning HTML. I remembered those incomplete solutions and thought I might as well create a webstite and put my incomplete solutions there. However, by that time, my solutions to the exercises were almost complete. And that's when it hit me: what if I created a solutions website with no missing solutions and call it the Missing solutions.</p>
<p>So here I am a few weeks later. Still no idea how a computer works but I made this site and I am proud to say that it is the very first (probably not) missing semester solutions collection with no missing solutions. I even added some extra exercises for lecture 10! (By the time of writing this there are still a lot of missing solutions on this site but let's just pretend for now.)</p>
<p>I tried to make this page as fool proof as possible but you can still <a href="https://github.com/simon-bouchard/missing-semester_solutions/issues" target="_blank"</a>report issues</a> on github or send me an email <a href="mailto:">here</a>. (I strongly adivise against the second option. Since it is not my real email, I have very little chance of actually seeing it.)</p>

<h5 id=solform>Solutions formatting</h5>
<p>Here is a quick guide on how to read the solutions</p>
<ul class=list>
	<li>Anything that isn't indented (or least indented) reprensents the exercises from the the course.</li>
	<li>Anything that is indented reprensents my solutions, instructions and explanations.</li>
	<li>Content displayed in light-gray, round bordered boxes reprensents command line inputs. In other words, what you should type in the shell, the solutions.</li>
	<li>Content displayed in black boxes reprensents command line output. I put it there so you can verify everything went accordingly or to make sure your solution (different) gave the same output.</li>
	<li>Content displayed in gray, dash bordered boxes represents input lines from the course exercises.</li>
	<li>Indented paragraphs that come before command inputs reprensents my instructions for that exercise.</li>
	<li>Indented paragraphs that come after command inputs and outputs reprensents explanations on the code used.</li>
</ul>
</div>

	<h5 id=aboutMusic>About the music</h5>
	<p>If you heard the music from the solutions page and thought "Mmhhh, those songs are good, I wish there was some place more convenient I could listen to his beats" well, <a href='theanswer.html' target="_blank">here</a> is the answer.</p>
