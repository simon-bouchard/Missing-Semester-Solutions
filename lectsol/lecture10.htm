	<h3><a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/potpourri/" target="_blank">Lecture 10</a></h3>
	<p>As promised here are the extra exercises for lecture 10. However no solutions will be provided for these exercises (no particular reason, I just don't feel like it).</p>
	<ol class=lectlist>
		<li><h6>Keyboard remapping</h6>
			Set up basic keyboard remapping, like rerouting Caps Lock to &lt;esc&gt; if you plan to continue using vim. If you are on windows you can use <a href='https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys/releases' target=_blank>Sharpkeys</a> or <a href='https://www.autohotkey.com/' target=_blank'>AutoHotkey</a> (the latter also allows to disable caps lock light).
		</li>

		<li>
			<h6>Backups & Booting + Live USBs</h6>
			Backup your computer in the cloud and if youre really confident, wipe out your whole computer and boot it with a live usb key (ideally prepared in advance if you only have one computer). Reinstall your computer set up from your cloud backup.
		</li>

		<li>
			<h6>APIs</h6>
			Create a simple app using an API. Could be the weather app suggested in the lecture or something more complicated.
		</li>

		<li>
			<h6>Github</h6>
			Get your first contribution by forking this website's repository and making a pull request.
		</li>

		<li>
			<h6>Docker, Vagrant, VMs, Cloud, OpenStack</h6>
			Get a virtual machine from the cloud. You can use Oracle Cloud's always free tier or whichever one you want. Try setting up a server. For example you could try set up a LAMP server hosting a website showing your solutions to the Missing Solutions extra exercises' solutions!
