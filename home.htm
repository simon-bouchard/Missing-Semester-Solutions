	<p>This page was created to add solutions to the <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/">2020 MIT missing semester</a> course exercises. It contains the solutions to the exercisesi of sessions 1 through 9 as well as some suggested exercises and their solutions for session 10 (there are no real exercises for sessions 10 and 11).</p>

	<p>Feel free to suggest changes and improvements to this page and to the solutions of the exercises via a pull request to the page's <a href=" https://github.com/simon-bouchard/missing-semester_solutions">github repository</a> (you will learn how through the course of this class).</p> 

	<p>I completed the exercises using ubuntu 22.04 on Wsl windows subsystem for linux.<br>
	My dotfiles that I developped whilst completing this class are availible <a href="https://github.com/simon-bouchard/dotfiles">here</a>.</p>
